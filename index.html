      <div class="topic">Designing Is My Passion</div>
      <p>I could go on for hours talking about designing, user-interface, development, and the work it takes to get it all done for visitors to see. The design process starts as soon as you sit with, notorize and interact with your client, strategizing about the end-product. </p>
      <p>You, as a client has to establish the goal of the website. Each website has it's own elements that contributes to the end result. The elements that have an impact are logo design, original content, website structure, link building... </p>
      <h4>that will help me execute any project with exclusive creative control.</h4>
